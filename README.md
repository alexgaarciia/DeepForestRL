# DeepForestRL
The goal of this repository is to develop deep reinforcement learning systems that use random forests instead of neural networks. It focuses on building, testing, and optimizing reinforcement learning models with random forests to assess their performance and applicability in various scenarios.

## Files and folders available in the repository
### Folders
- `Papers`: This folder includes several research papers with information about how to combine reinforcement learning with random forests.
- `Simple examples (RF, ORF)`: Contains two Python files that implement a simple random forest and an online random forest.

### Files
- `On combining RL with RFs.pdf`: A presentation that discusses what reinforcement learning (RL) and random forests (RF) are, the pros of their combination, the main difficulties in combining them, investigations that have combined them, and some proposals on how to combine them.
- `main.R`: This R script is the core file in the repository. It includes several key components for the experiment with Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Random Forests in a simulated grid world environment.
- `neural_networks_q_learning.py`: Implements Q-learning with neural networks.
- `random_forests_q_learning.py`: Implements Q-learning, but the neural networks part has been replaced with random forests.
