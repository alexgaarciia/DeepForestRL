# DeepForestRL
The goal of this repository is to develop deep reinforcement learning systems that use random forests instead of neural networks. It focuses on building, testing, and optimizing reinforcement learning models with random forests to assess their performance and applicability in various scenarios.

## Files and folders available in the repository
- `Papers`:
- `Simple examples (RF, ORF)`:
- `On combining RL with RFs.pdf`:
- `main.R`: This R script is the core file in the repository. It includes several key components for the experiment with Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Random Forests in a simulated grid world environment.
